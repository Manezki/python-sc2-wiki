Welcome to the `python-sc2` documentation!

If you have not played StarCraft II before, I suggest looking at the [game overview in Liquipedia](http://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/StarCraft). It covers the basic terminology and strategy.

* [Aku's SC2 Primer](https://gist.github.com/eagleflo/a9f3c306495ecf5e7bc0fb678870b02f)
* Getting started: [Worker rush](./Worker-rush-bot)
* API docs: [BotAI class](./The-BotAI-class), [Units and actions](./Units-and-actions)

Plans for this repository in the near future can be [found on this trello board](https://trello.com/b/ieMgHqfq)
