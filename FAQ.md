# Should I use the [pysc2](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2) or [python-sc2](https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2) library?
If you plan on making scripted hardcoded bots, python-sc2 is simpler in its syntax.

If you want to make a machine learning bot, pysc2 is probably the better choice since it uses the UI and feature layers (spatial interfaces).
